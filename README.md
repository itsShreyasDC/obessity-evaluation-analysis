# obessity-evaluation-analysis
This project is built upon Social Networking concepts like <b>Homophily, Triadic and Foci closure and Social influence</b><br/>
The repo consists of evolutionary_model.py to generate a social network and evaluates automatically based on above mentioned factors<br/>
<b><i> Please note </b></i>
<ul>
homophily factor based on <i>1/(|bmi of u - bmi of v|*1000)</i> the threshold of probablity is randamized <br/>
Closure is set with probablity <i>(1-0.01)^K </i>where K is no of neighbour<br/>
The evolution_"time".gml is the evolution of obesity with time/itteration
</ul>
